🚀 hello-ai-avs
hello-ai-avs is Actively Validated Service (AVS) example for AI inference on-chain.
It shows how you could use an AVS to coordinate submitting, processing, and verifying AI inference tasks using smart contracts.

📌 What does it do?
Defines an AVSManager contract that lets users:

Create inference tasks by providing input data.

Submit inference results that can be validated on-chain.

Demonstrates how an AI operator (or off-chain worker) could pick up tasks, run inference (currently via Together AI Api key), and return the result.

Provides a starting point for experimenting with decentralized AI inference as an AVS on EigenLayer or similar frameworks.

⚡ What can it become?
This is an early, minimal prototype. In the future, it can evolve to:

Add staking, slashing, and challenge mechanisms to ensure operators return correct results.

Enable multiple operators to reach consensus on inference outputs.

Reward operators with on-chain incentives for accurate results.

Integrate with EigenLayer to inherit Ethereum’s trust guarantees.

🛠️ Project Status
✅ Minimal prototype
🚧 Not production-ready
🧩 Open for experimentation and extension

📂 Structure
AVSManager.sol — Smart contract defining the basic task lifecycle.

More modules will come as the AVS logic grows (registration, challenge, rewards, slashing).
